# minimal docker setup for texlive and Julia

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

For testing Julia packages that rely on [TeXLive](https://tug.org/texlive/). It was written primarily for [PGFPlotsX.jl](https://github.com/KristofferC/PGFPlotsX.jl), may be useful for other Julia projects that have extensive binary dependencies (with modifications, of course, you need to edit the [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile)).

## Usage

Call `docker` as something like

```sh
docker run -ti -a STDOUT -a STDIN -a STDERR -v .:/mnt texlive-julia-minimal /test/test-script.sh stable PGFPlotsX
```

ie

1. the source for the package is mounted at `/mnt` in the container (this is hardcoded into the scripts)

2. `stable` is the version, the alternative is `nightly`,

3. the last argument is the package name.

## What's in the image

1. a minimal TeXLive distribution

2. script to install Julia from official binaries

3. stable version of Julia installed in `/test/julia-stable/`.

## Local testing

[`build-locally.sh`](build-locally.sh) builds the Docker image locally, while [`run-locally.sh`](run-locally.sh) can be used to make test runs. The Docker suite needs to be installed for both.
